Find your Passion

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:15,500
So, there was a wonderful article by Steven Kotler, published in Forbes about How to find your passion.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,700
It's a question we ask ourselves every single day.

4
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,900
We've all been told that a life of passion is a life that means something.

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,590
But how do we identify our passions?

6
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,290
It's not always easy.

7
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,750
So one of the things that Steven Kotler breaks down is that he says that

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:37,350
passion essentially exists in the intersection between multiple things that you're curious about.

9
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,090
So he says, "The first thing you should do if you wanna identify you passion is to make a list

10
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,500
of all the things that you're curious about."

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,390
All the things that you wonder about.

12
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,390
Be specific as you can.

13
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,390
And then create a kind of a Venn diagram,

14
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:55,190
and try to figure out where the things that you're curious about, three or more, intersect.

15
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,100
And that's the sweet spot.

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,150
That's where there is energy, that's where there is dopamine and neurobiology.

17
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:06,350
Multiple streams of curiosity intersect at a space called passion, right?

18
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,350
And then once you've identified your passion,

19
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,350
then you can figure out how to turn that passion into a purpose.

20
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,150
Turn that passion into a purpose.

21
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,650
Make a list of fifteen things in the world,

22
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,300
fifteen challenges you'd like to see solved.

23
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,300
And figure out which one of those challenges can be served by your passion.

24
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,300
So then you see it.

25
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,470
Curiosity leads to passion.

26
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,490
Multiple streams of curiosity leads to passion.

27
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,690
Identifying problems in the world that can be served by your passion leads to purpose.

28
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:37,300
And then, my friends, you've impregnated your life with a sense of significance, with as sense of meaning.

29
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,300
And then you can go forth, my brothers.

30
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,500
You can go forth.

31
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,090
I thought it was a great article.

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,250
